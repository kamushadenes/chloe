# iOS

Chloe isn't REALLY implemented for iOS, but I created a Shortcut based on [this one](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c700aede703b49218244132a0cec4864) using OpenAI and Google's TTS engine using the same default prompt Chloe have.

In the future, I'll change this shortcut to talk to Chloe's HTTP interface so you can leverage all the features Chloe has.

## Setup

Just click the link below from your iOS device.

<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b9f8344df2d142f487391f9f3a0b0efd"><img alt="Chloe Shortcut" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Download%20Chloe%20Shortcut-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=ffffff" /></a>

When you first add it, it's going to ask you about your name, the default greeting phrase, your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/), and your [Google Cloud API key](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys).

To invoke the shortcut, you can either say `Hey Siri, Hey Chloe` or create a shortcut on your home screen.

You can also change the shortcut name to whatever you want, and that will change the invocation phrase as well.
