# Configuration

There are several defaults defined in the `config` package, including things like database
connection string, generated image sizes and timeouts. Those can be overridden by setting the
relevant environment variables.

Of those, the only required one is the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one by
signing up for an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).

Configuration documentation is separated in several files, listed below.
